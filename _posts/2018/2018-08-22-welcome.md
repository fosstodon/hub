#### Welcome to the new Fosstodon Hub!

Now, you may be thinking to yourself _"why on earth does a social network need a blog?"_ Well, we wanted a place where we could make announcements and talk to you guys where the 500 character limit of Fosstodon isn't enough. For example:<!--more-->

*   New Mastodon features etc.
*   Announcements about the Fosstodon project as a whole.
*   Details of any donations we make to other projects.
*   Anything else we feel is important.

We intend for this blog to be a single source of truth when it comes to official announcements, news and information about all things Fosstodon. Whenever we publish a new post on here, we will post a link on our [official Fosstodon account](https://fosstodon.org/@fosstodon), so please make sure you're following that account if you're a Fosstodon member.

You can also subscribe to the [RSS feed](/feed) on this site, is you so wish.
