Over the last year or so, we have had a handful of members leave Fosstodon to either start their own instance (which is awesome), or to join another instance as they feel they can't post about subjects other than FOSS on Fosstodon (not so awesome).<!--more-->

Our [Code of Conduct](/coc) says the following in the **Goals** section:

> Provide a venue for casual conversations — we may all be passionate about technology, but that doesn't mean that our conversations always centre on that shared passion.

#### That's right, we're not just FOSS!

We have always said from the start that free & open source software, or tech in general, is a common passion that our members have. However, that isn't what defines us as people, and it certainly isn't the only subject we want our members to talk about.

For example, [Kev](https://fosstodon.org/@kev) is into motorbikes and fish-keeping, [Gina](https://fosstodon.org/@gina) is into bouldering and fitness...both Kev and Gina are into dogs! They both post about these subject regularly, as well a tech stuff.

## Diversity of thought

We want Fosstodon to be a place where people feel comfortable posting about any passion or interest they have. So long as it aligns to the rest of our CoC, then we're all good.

So, the next time you're thinking about posting something that isn't FOSS related - **DO IT!** We hate to see members of our little corner of the fediverse leave, just because they feel like they can't post anything other than FOSS.
