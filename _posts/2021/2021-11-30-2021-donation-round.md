We recently started [another round of donations for this year](time-to-show-some-foss-love/) where we had enough spare funds to **donate $300 to two open source projects**.

First came the nominations round where a tonne a really great open source projects were nominated. We love seeing this level of involvement from the Fosstodon community - keep it up, folks!

Once we had the shortlist nailed down, we de-duped it and gave it to [our Patrons](https://patreon.com/fosstodon) to cast the final vote in order to decide which 2 projects receive the donations.

## The results
The spread of the results was surprising this time around - usually we have one or two clear winners. This time, although we had 2 winners, it was very close:

So with 4 and 3 votes respectively, the winners of this round of donations were:
* [postmarketOS](https://postmarketos.org/)
* [European Digital Rights](https://edri.org/)
