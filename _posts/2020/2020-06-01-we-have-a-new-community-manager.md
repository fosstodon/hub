**Back in April, [we asked](/we-need-a-community-manager) our ever growing community of members whether any of them would like to become our new Community Manager.**

After a number of applications from the community, Mike and I have finally decided on who our new Community Manager is going to be.<!--more-->

Before I get to announcing who that actually is, I'd like to tell you a little bit about why we thought we needed a community manager, and what they're going to be responsible for at Fosstodon.

## Why do we need a community manager?

Well, Fosstodon is growing fast. In less than 3 years we have gone from being a "community" of 2 members (myself and Mike), to over 10,000 members today. It's amazing.

In the early days, managing Fosstodon was easy - there weren't many reports to deal with, and we didn't have much in the way of a community.

No one was really giving us feedback on how to improve, or coming to us with ideas. No one was donating to the community, so we had no additional funds to [make donations](/about).

**That's all changed.**

Now we regularly get feedback from our community and our funding is strong, so we have spare cash that we can use to donate to open source projects.

The problem is, Mike and I are way too busy with our full time jobs, our personal lives, and all the work that is needed behind the scenes to keep Fosstodon running.

**That's where our new community manager comes in.**

## Responsibilities of our community manager

Mike and I have spoken to our new community manager to make them aware of what they're getting into and for some reason they're happy to move forward!

We think that by having a CM in the team, we will be able to offer our members a fuller, more welcoming experience on Fosstodon. Our new CM will be responsible for, but not limited to, the following:

* **Engaging with the community** - responding to feedback and answering questions.
* **Working on the donations process** so we can make sure we're making donations to open source projects on a regular basis.
* **Growing this community** of ours to ensure it's just as great when we have 50,000 members as it is now.
* **Coming up with new ideas** to engage the community. For example, our recent #100DaysToOffload was a real success.
* **Keeping this blog up to date** with what's going on in Fosstodon.
* **Writing and maintaining documentation**, like our [code of conduct](https://hub.fosstodon.org/code-of-conduct).
* **Generally being awesome.**

## Who is the new community manager?

Ok, ok. I've left you hanging long enough. Drum roll please......

**Our new community manager is [Cooper](https://fosstodon.org/@cooper).**

Cooper has been a Fosstodon member for over a year now, and brings with him a lot of experience managing other communities. So we're really happy to have him on the Fosstodon team.

If you have any ideas for the community, or want to get in touch with Cooper, you can do so via email or via all the usual Mastodon methods.

**[community@fosstodon.org](mailto:community@fosstodon.org)**

Finally, I'd like to end this update with a huge thank you to all of our community. without you guys, it would still just be Mike and I on our own, with no friends. :-)

**Welcome to the team, Cooper!**
