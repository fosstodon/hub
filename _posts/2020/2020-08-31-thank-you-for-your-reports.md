Recently, several of you made reports of a few accounts that were making concerning toots surrounding pedophilia and the likes thereof. Considering the nature of the content and breach of our [CoC](/coc), our Fosstodon Staff Members acted quickly to isolate and remove the accounts/toots.<!--more-->

All-in-all, it appears this was a targeted attack across 6 accounts, of which, none were bots. The involved accounts all joined within the last 24hrs. and boosted each other's toots in order to increase exposure.

Due to the overwhelming concern that was raised, by many of our community members, we felt that it was appropriate to provide a formal update and thank you for your reports. Again, we appreciate all the reports that came in, regarding this matter, and encourage everyone to remain vigilant with your reports of suspicious or concerning activity.
