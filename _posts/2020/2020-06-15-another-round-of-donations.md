**Fosstodon is preparing to make 2 donations to a couple of open source projects, in the amount of $200 each. We need our Fosstodon members' input on where to send those donations.** <!--more-->

[Click here](https://zfrmz.eu/vpqdICp7XIsYFPyd50gi ) to submit the info for an open source project that you'd like us to support!

We'll stop taking submissions, on 6/26. At that time, our Fosstodon Patreons will vote on those submissions and narrow it down to 2 entries.

If you're interested in having a say on where the donations will go, you can sign up to become a Patreon, [here](https://patreon.com/fosstodon).

*A HUGE "thanks!" to all of our current Patreons, as we wouldn't be able to do this awesome stuff without you guys!*
