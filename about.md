## About Us

The point of Fosstodon is to be a social network community of people who like
Free & Open Source Software (FOSS). We've grown a lot since we were founded by
[Kev Quirk](https://fosstodon.org/@kev) and [Mike Stone](https://fosstodon.org/@mike).

👋 [Meet the team!](/team)

Running a social network is expensive. Originally runded out of the founders
pockets, the site eventually needed [support](/support) from the generous
community that calls it home. Since we began taking donations, we committed to
[being transparent](/finances) and "paying it forward" by donating extra money
to other Open Source projects.
