## About Us

Fosstodon is a social network used by a diverse community of people who like
Free & Open Source Software (FOSS). We've grown a lot since we were founded by
[Kev Quirk](https://fosstodon.org/@kev) and [Mike Stone](https://fosstodon.org/@mike)
in 2017.

👋 [Meet the team!](/team)

Running a social network is expensive. Originally funded out of the founders'
pockets, the site eventually needed [support](/support) from the generous
community that calls it home. Since we began taking donations, we have been
committed to [being transparent](/finances) and "paying it forward" by
donating extra money to other Open Source projects.
