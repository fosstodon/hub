## Thank you!! 

We want to extend our heartfelt gratitude to all our community members who have generously contributed through donations. Your support means the world to us. We want to emphasize that while we greatly appreciate any donations, you should never feel obligated in any way. Your participation in our community, whether through contributions or simply being a part of it, is valued above all else. We are here to provide a space that you can enjoy, and your involvement is a choice, not obligation. Thank you for being a vital part of our community.

## How we assign funds

When you make a donation, either by [Patreon](https://patreon.com/fosstodon) or [PayPal](https://paypal.me/fosstodonorg), it eventually ends up in our PayPal account. With this funding we do a couple of things:

1.  We keep a 6 month float of running costs; so we know we have funding in place should we need extra cash for things like an unexpected server upgrade.
2.  Anything over and above our running costs is accumulated in to donations to open source projects that our Patrons get to choose. We tend to save these funds up so we can make meaningful donations – usually a minimum of $100/donation.

## Project donations process

Once we have enough funds saved up to make a donation to a project, we will create a Patron-only post on our Patreon page, which include details on how you can recommend a project for donation.

Once we have some recommendations from our Patrons, [the team](/team) will create a short list. Once the short list is created, we will create a survey so all of our members can vote on which project should get the donation.

Again, this will stay open for a week and the project with the most votes at the end will get the donation.

We will then post details of any donations made to this page.
